# PopularMoviesApp

This is the second project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app, optimized for tablets, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers, launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.

## Features:

1. Discover the most popular or the highest rated movies
2. Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
3. Fetches and displays movies from TMDb API, represented by their posters.
4. Displayes details about movies (ratings, release date, etc..)
5. Shows videos related to movies (trailers, featuretes, etc..)
6. Reviews from TMDb users.
7. Adheres to Material Design specs.
